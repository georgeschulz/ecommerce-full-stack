Not only did they fully understand what was needed but they were able to accommodate our tight timeline. Every employee we spoke to or welcomed into our home was professional and courteous. We canâ€™t thank you enough for your assistance! We have been happy customers for over 10 years and will continue!"

I was looking for a refinance termite inspection and Better came up in my search, I was helped by Michelle via chat and received a call in less than an hour from Brian who had a slot available the next day. Totally awesome! Less than 24 hours from when I searched to having a terrific affordable and prompt service completed. I will use Better Termite and Pest Control again and offer my strongest recommendation for others to use Better for their termite/pest needs."
